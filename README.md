Repository of my Developer Profile.
This is a personal proyect to show some of my programming skills that I've learned through the years, it's main structured in React.js and it includes many react functional components to make easier the creation of some elements, it use some hooks to communicate the state of some elements. It's styled on CSS with care in every detail, simulating the pixel art style in most of the aspects of the web page.
Inside you can find all the programming languages that I can handle, soft skills of mine and also personal contact information.
