Repository to my web page
This is a personal proyect to show some of my programming skills that I've learn through the years, it main structure has been built in pure React.js and includes many react functional components to make easier the creation of some elements, it use some hooks to communicate the state of some of the elements. It's styled on CSS with care in every detail, simulating the pixel art style in every aspect of the web page.
Inside you can find all the programming languages that I can handle and also personal contact information.
